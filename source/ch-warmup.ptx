    These notes will be used to guide our discussion for the course MTHM 182 at Lorain County Community College.
    The title of this course is Calculus II. The course is designed to follow the State of Ohio's OT36 course outcomes for TMM006: Calculus II.

    analysis of series with comparison, ratio, root, integral, and alternating series tests; power series, representation of functions 
    by power series, and Taylor polynomials; and analysis of curves described parametrically, or in polar form.

    This chapter contains material that is typiclaly treated in a first semester Calculus course. 
    Students in Calculus II should be comfortable with this material going into the course, 
    but may need to go over this material if they have had a long break or a did not see it in thier 
    first calculus course.
