    MTHM 182 will be broken up into 5 sections, corresponding roughly to the categories listed above. If this list above is intidating, that is okay,
    this is a summary of the things we are going to learn this semester. I have tried to break this material intro five chapters. Chapters 2 - 6 of these notes should
    correspond to the five midterm examinations we will have in this course.

    The remainder of this Chapter (Chapter 1) will cover some prerequistive material. Students should be reasonably comfortable with this material, but may need to update their
    understanding of some topics. It is also possible that I will write things in a way slighly different than you are used to, please feel confident
    to ask any questions about this, such questions are likely to help everybody.

    <title> Functions </title>
    <p>This is a reminder about functions.</p>
      <definition xml:id="def-function">
          <notation>
            <usage><m>f</m></usage> 
            <description>A function</description>
          </notation>
          <notation>
            <usage><m>f(x)</m>></usage>
            <description>The output of the function <m>f</m> performed on an input <m>x</m>. Typically we think of <m>x</m> as a real number. </description>
          </notation>
          <notation>
            <usage><m>\Bbb R</m></usage>
            <description>The set of real numbers.</description>
          </notation>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term> function </term>, <m> f</m> is set rule for producing outputs from inputs. That is to say, 
            a function <m> f</m> is a rule that assigns a unique output <m> f(x) </m> to an input <m> x</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The <term> domain </term> of the function <m> f </m> is the set whose elements are those input values <m> x </m> for which the 
            output <m> f(x) </m> of the function is clearly defined. The <term> codomain </term> of <m>f</m> is a set that contains the output <m>f(x)</m>
            for every single input <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
          We often take the codomian of a funciton <m>f</m> to be the set <m>\Bbb R</m> of real numbers. We are often given a function <m>f</m> as a <term>partial funciton</term> 
          where the rule describing the function is given by an equation for <m>f(x)</m> in terms of <m>x</m> and the domain of <m>f</m> is understood to be the set of real numbers <m>x</m> for which the formula makes sense.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <remark>
        <p>
          The set of all outputs of the function <m>f</m> is called the <term>range</term> of <m>f</m>. This set can be smaller than the codomain and is sually harder to understand.
